## Overview
In this project, I have developed APIs that integrate seamlessly with the frontend, enabling the following key functionalities:

1. **Generate Mermaid Syntax**: Allows users to generate diagrams dynamically using Mermaid.js syntax.
2. **Analyze Images and Answer Questions**: Utilizes advanced AI to analyze images and answer physics, math, or other image-based questions, including whiteboard drawings.
3. **Assist with Note-taking**: Provides tools for generating notes efficiently, aiding productivity and organization.

These functionalities are powered by the Gemini API, which has provided a robust foundation for understanding and implementing Edgechain concepts. 
However, there are areas where improvements can be made to enhance the user experience and functionality.

## Next Steps
To address the limitations and further enhance the project, I plan to implement the following updates:

### 1. Custom System Prompt Template
- Design a **custom system prompt template** to optimize interactions and responses.
- Leverage the effectiveness of system prompts to guide AI models for more accurate and relevant outputs.

### 2. System Prompt Integration for Developers
- Introduce an option for developers to include custom **system prompts** in AI models.
- Ensure compatibility and flexibility for various AI models to enhance their usability.

### 3. Multimodal Support for Chat Models
- Extend **multimodal support** across all chat models(that has multimodal functionality)
- Ensure smooth integration for a holistic user experience.

## Improving Documentation
To maintain clarity and professionalism, I will revise the README.md file to:

- Provide **better formatting** for readability.
- Clearly outline the existing functionalities and their use cases.
- Detail the new updates with a focus on:
  - The custom system prompt template.
  - System prompt integration for developers.
  - Multimodal support in chat models.

## Conclusion
These enhancements aim to make the project more developer-friendly and extend its capabilities, ensuring a comprehensive and intuitive experience. By focusing on system prompts and multimodal support, the project will better align with cutting-edge AI advancements, providing greater value to users and developers alike.
